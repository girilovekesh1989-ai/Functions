Generators also simplify the representation of infinite sequences and are easier to implement for complex iterators because they manage iteration state automatically.\n",

This makes them extremely memory-efficient, especially when dealing with massive datasets or streams of data that would otherwise exceed memory capacity.\n",

        "     -**Lazy Evaluation:** Generators use lazy evaluation, meaning values are generated only when requested. This improves performance by reducing the computational overhead and avoiding the need to process and store data that might not even be used.\n",
